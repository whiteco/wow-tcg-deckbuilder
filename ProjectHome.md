The DeckBuilder is an off-line deck management program that allows you to keep track of your collection as well as intelligently help you to create and manage your decks.

The program currently has a Card Browser where you can look through and quickly search through all the cards in the Card Database.

The second and main function is the DeckBuilder portion of the program that has many of the same functions of the Card Browser, but allows you to find and add cards to a deck you create. You can also get the stats for your deck as well as draw simulator.

Both parts of the program have export functions either to print or to output to an Excel worksheet.

The program has a second part, the Card Database Updater, that is updated more frequently when errors are found in card entries in the database or when new sets are released.

Both of these programs were made and tested with Excel 2003 on Windows Vista. The program should work with Excel 2000/2007 and with Windows XP, but it was not tested on those platforms.
